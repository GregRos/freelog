# Freelog
Freelog is a powerful logging library that lets you log things in a way that's perfectly tailored to *your* application. It can help you implement in a complex system with multiple processes, log sources, etc.

Freelog is inspired by bunyan, but it's different in that pretty much everything, starting from log levels and ending in how log events are processed, is meant to be easily customizable.
